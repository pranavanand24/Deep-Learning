# Using Keras and Tensorflow to build deep Learning and NLP Models
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.



TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google and has become very popular with Machine Learning. TensorFlow offers APIs that facilitates Machine Learning. TensorFlow also has a faster compilation time than other Deep Learning libraries such as Keras and Touch.
